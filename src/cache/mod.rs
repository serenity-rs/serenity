//! A cache of events received over a `Shard`, where storing at least some
//! data from the event is possible.
//!
//! This acts as a cache, to avoid making requests over the REST API through
//! the [`http`] module where possible. All fields are public, and do not have
//! getters, to allow you more flexibility with the stored data. However, this
//! allows data to be "corrupted", and _may or may not_ cause misfunctions
//! within the library. Mutate data at your own discretion.
//!
//! A "globally available" instance of the Cache is available at
//! [`client::CACHE`]. This is the instance that is updated by the library,
//! meaning you should _not_ need to maintain updating it yourself in any case.
//!
//! # Use by Models
//!
//! Most models of Discord objects, such as the [`Message`], [`PublicChannel`],
//! or [`Emoji`], have methods for interacting with that single instance. This
//! feature is only compiled if the `methods` feature is enabled. An example of
//! this is [`LiveGuild::edit`], which performs a check to ensure that the
//! current user is the owner of the guild, prior to actually performing the
//! HTTP request. The cache is involved due to the function's use of unlocking
//! the cache and retrieving the Id of the current user, and comparing it to
//! the Id of the user that owns the guild. This is an inexpensive method of
//! being able to access data required by these sugary methods.
//!
//! # Do I need the Cache?
//!
//! If you're asking this, the answer is likely "definitely yes" or
//! "definitely no"; any in-between tends to be "yes". If you are low on RAM,
//! and need to run on only a couple MB, then the answer is "definitely no". If
//! you do not care about RAM and want your bot to be able to access data
//! while needing to hit the REST API as little as possible, then the answer
//! is "yes".
