//! The Client contains information about a single bot's token, as well as event handlers.
//! Dispatching events to configured handlers and starting the shards' connections are handled
//! directly via the client. In addition, the `http` module and `Cache` are also automatically
//! handled by the Client module for you.
//!
//! A [`Context`] is provided for every handler.
//!
//! The `http` module is the lower-level method of interacting with the Discord REST API.
//! Realistically, there should be little reason to use this yourself, as the Context will do this
//! for you. A possible use case of using the `http` module is if you do not have a Cache, for
//! purposes such as low memory requirements.
//!
//! Click [here][Client examples] for an example on how to use a `Client`.
