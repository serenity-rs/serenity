/// ```rust,no_run

/// use std::env;
///
/// let token = env::var("DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN").unwrap();
/// let mut client = Client::login_bot(&token);
///
/// client.on_member_unban(|context, guild_id, user| {
///     let discriminator = user.discriminator.parse::<u16>().unwrap();
///
///     // If the user has an even discriminator, don't re-ban them.
///     if discriminator % 2 == 0 {
///         return;
///     }

///     match context.ban(guild_id, user, 8) {
///         Ok(()) => {
///             // Ban successful.
