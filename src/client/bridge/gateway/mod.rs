//! The client gateway bridge is support essential for the [`client`][client] module.
//!
//! This is made available for user use if one wishes to be lower-level or avoid
//! the higher functionality of the [`Client`].
//!
//! Of interest are three pieces:
//!
//! ### [`ShardManager`]
//!
//! The shard manager is responsible for being a clean interface between the
//! user and the shard runners, providing essential functions such as
//! [`ShardManager::shutdown`] to shutdown a shard and [`ShardManager::restart`]
//! to restart a shard.
//!
//! If you are using the `Client`, this is likely the only piece of interest to
//! you. Refer to [its documentation][`ShardManager`] for more information.
//!
//! ### [`ShardQueuer`]
//!
//! The shard queuer is a light wrapper around an mpsc receiver that receives
//! [`ShardManagerMessage`]s. It should be run in its own thread so it can
//! receive messages to start shards in a queue.
//!
//! Refer to [its documentation][`ShardQueuer`] for more information.
//!
//! ### [`ShardRunner`]
//!
//! The shard runner is responsible for actually running a shard and
//! communicating with its respective WebSocket client.
//!
//! It is performs all actions such as sending a presence update over the client
//! and, with the help of the [`Shard`], will be able to determine what to do.
//! This is, for example, whether to reconnect, resume, or identify with the
//! gateway.
//!
//! ### In Conclusion
//!
//! For almost every - if not every - use case, you only need to _possibly_ be
//! concerned about the [`ShardManager`] in this module.
