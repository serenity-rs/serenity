//! A set of extended functionality that is not required for a [`Client`] and/or
//! [`Shard`] to properly function.
//!
//! These are flagged behind feature-gates and can be enabled and disabled.
//!
//! See each extension's module-level documentation for more information.
//!
//! Note that the framework module requires the `framework` feature to be
//! enabled (enabled by default), the cache requires the `cache` feature to be
//! enabled (enabled by default), and voice support requires the `voice` feature
//! to be enabled (disabled by default).
