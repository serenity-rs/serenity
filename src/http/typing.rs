/// A struct to start typing in a [`Channel`] for an indefinite period of time.
///
/// It indicates that the current user is currently typing in the channel.
///
/// Typing is started by using the [`Typing::start`] method and stopped by using the
/// [`Typing::stop`] method. Note that on some clients, typing may persist for a few seconds after
/// [`Typing::stop`] is called. Typing is also stopped when the struct is dropped.
///
/// If a message is sent while typing is triggered, the user will stop typing for a brief period of
/// time and then resume again until either [`Typing::stop`] is called or the struct is dropped.
///
/// This should rarely be used for bots, although it is a good indicator that a long-running
/// command is still being processed.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use serenity::{http::{Http, Typing}, Result, model::prelude::*};
/// # use std::sync::Arc;
/// #
/// # fn long_process() {}
/// # fn main() -> Result<()> {
/// # let http: Http = unimplemented!();
/// let channel_id = ChannelId::new(7);
/// // Initiate typing (assuming `http` is bound)
/// let typing = Typing::start(Arc::new(http), channel_id)?;
///
/// // Run some long-running process
/// long_process();
///
/// // Stop typing
/// typing.stop();
/// # Ok(())
