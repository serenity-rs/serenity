/// A struct to start typing in a [`Channel`] for an indefinite period of time.
///
/// It indicates that the current user is currently typing in the channel.
///
/// Typing is started by using the [`Typing::start`] method
/// and stopped by using the [`Typing::stop`] method.
/// Note that on some clients, typing may persist for a few seconds after `stop` is called.
/// Typing is also stopped when the struct is dropped.
///
/// If a message is sent while typing is triggered, the user will stop typing for a brief period
/// of time and then resume again until either `stop` is called or the struct is dropped.
///
/// This should rarely be used for bots, although it is a good indicator that a
/// long-running command is still being processed.

/// ## Examples
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use serenity::{http::{Http, Typing}, Result};
/// # use std::sync::Arc;
/// #
/// # fn long_process() {}
/// # fn main() -> Result<()> {
/// # let http = Http::default();
/// // Initiate typing (assuming `http` is bound)
/// let typing = Typing::start(Arc::new(http), 7)?;
///
/// // Run some long-running process
/// long_process();
///
/// // Stop typing
/// typing.stop();
/// #
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
