//! The HTTP module which provides functions for performing requests to endpoints in Discord's API.
//!
//! An important function of the REST API is ratelimiting. Requests to endpoints are ratelimited to
//! prevent spam, and once ratelimited Discord will stop performing requests. The library
//! implements protection to pre-emptively ratelimit, to ensure that no wasted requests are made.
//!
//! The HTTP module comprises of two types of requests:
//! - REST API requests, which require an authorization token;
//! - Other requests, which do not require an authorization token.
//!
//! The former require a [`Client`] to have logged in, while the latter may be made regardless of
//! any other usage of the library.
//!
//! If a request spuriously fails, it will be retried once.
//!
//! Note that you may want to perform requests through a [model]s' instance methods where possible,
//! as they each offer different levels of a high-level interface to the HTTP module.
//!
//! [`Client`]: crate::Client
//! [model]: crate::model
