//! The HTTP module which provides functions for performing requests to
//! endpoints in Discord's API.
//!
//! An important function of the REST API is ratelimiting. Requests to endpoints
//! are ratelimited to prevent spam, and once ratelimited Discord will stop
//! performing requests. The library implements protection to pre-emptively
//! ratelimit, to ensure that no wasted requests are made.
//!
//! The HTTP module comprises of two types of requests:
//!
//! - REST API requests, which require an authorization token;
//! - Other requests, which do not require an authorization token.
//!
//! The former require a [`Client`] to have logged in, while the latter may be
//! made regardless of any other usage of the library.
//!
//! If a request spuriously fails, it will be retried once.
//!
//! Note that you may want to perform requests through a [model]s'
//! instance methods where possible, as they each offer different
//! levels of a high-level interface to the HTTP module.
//!
//! [`Client`]: ../client/struct.Client.html
//! [model]: ../model/index.html
