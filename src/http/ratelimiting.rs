//! Routes are used for ratelimiting. These are to differentiate between the
//! different _types_ of routes - such as getting the current user's channels -
//! for the most part, with the exception being major parameters.
//!
//! [Taken from] the Discord docs, major parameters are:
//!
//! > Additionally, rate limits take into account major parameters in the URL.
//! > For example, `/channels/:channel_id` and
//! > `/channels/:channel_id/messages/:message_id` both take `channel_id` into
//! > account when generating rate limits since it's the major parameter. The
//! only current major parameters are `channel_id` and `guild_id`.
//!
//! This results in the two URIs of `GET /channels/4/messages/7` and
//! `GET /channels/5/messages/8` being rate limited _separately_. However, the
//! two URIs of `GET /channels/10/messages/11` and
//! `GET /channels/10/messages/12` will count towards the "same ratelimit", as
//! the major parameter - `10` is equivalent in both URIs' format.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! First: taking the first two URIs - `GET /channels/4/messages/7` and
//! `GET /channels/5/messages/8` - and assuming both buckets have a `limit` of
//! `10`, requesting the first URI will result in the response containing a
//! `remaining` of `9`. Immediately after - prior to buckets resetting -
//! performing a request to the _second_ URI will also contain a `remaining` of
//! `9` in the response, as the major parameter - `channel_id` - is different
//! in the two requests (`4` and `5`).
//!
//! Second: take for example the last two URIs. Assuming the bucket's `limit` is
//! `10`, requesting the first URI will return a `remaining` of `9` in the
//! response. Immediately after - prior to buckets resetting - performing a
//! request to the _second_ URI will return a `remaining` of `8` in the
//! response, as the major parameter - `channel_id` - is equivalent for the two
//! requests (`10`).
//!
//! Major parameters are why some variants (i.e. all of the channel/guild
//! variants) have an associated u64 as data. This is the Id of the parameter,
//! differentiating between different ratelimits.
