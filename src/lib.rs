//! Serenity is a Rust library for the Discord API.
//!
//! View the [examples] on how to make and structure a bot.
//!
//! Serenity supports bot user authentication via the use of [`Client::new`].
//!
//! Once logged in, you may add handlers to your client to dispatch [`Event`]s,
//! such as [`Client::on_message`]. This will cause your handler to be called
//! when a [`Event::MessageCreate`] is received. Each handler is given a
//! [`Context`], giving information about the event. See the
//! [client's module-level documentation].
//!
//! The [`Shard`] is transparently handled by the library, removing
//! unnecessary complexity. Sharded connections are automatically handled for
//! you. See the [gateway's documentation][gateway docs] for more information.
//!
//! A [`Cache`] is also provided for you. This will be updated automatically for
//! you as data is received from the Discord API via events. When calling a
//! method on a [`Context`], the cache will first be searched for relevant data
//! to avoid unnecessary HTTP requests to the Discord API. For more information,
//! see the [cache's module-level documentation][cache docs].
//!
//! Note that, although this documentation will try to be as up-to-date and
//! accurate as possible, Discord hosts [official documentation][docs]. If you
//! need to be sure that some information piece is sanctioned by Discord, refer
//! to their own documentation.
//!
//! # Example Bot
//!
//! A basic ping-pong bot looks like:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! #[macro_use] extern crate serenity;
//!
//! # #[cfg(all(feature = "client", feature = "standard_framework"))]
//! # mod inner {
//! #
//! use serenity::client::{Client, EventHandler};
//! use serenity::framework::standard::StandardFramework;
//! use std::env;
//!
//! struct Handler;
//!
//! impl EventHandler for Handler {}
//!
//! pub fn main() {
//!     // Login with a bot token from the environment
//!     let mut client = Client::new(&env::var("DISCORD_TOKEN").expect("token"), Handler)
//!         .expect("Error creating client");
//!
//!     client.with_framework(StandardFramework::new()
//!         .configure(|c| c.prefix("~")) // set the bot's prefix to "~"
//!         .cmd("ping", ping));
//!
//!     // start listening for events by starting a single shard
//!     if let Err(why) = client.start() {
//!         println!("An error occurred while running the client: {:?}", why);
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! command!(ping(_context, message) {
//!     let _ = message.reply("Pong!");
//! });
//! #
//! # }
//! #
//! # #[cfg(all(feature = "client", feature = "standard_framework"))]
//! # fn main() { inner::main() }
//! # #[cfg(not(all(feature = "client", feature = "standard_framework")))]
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! ### Full Examples
//!
//! Full examples, detailing and explaining usage of the basic functionality of the
//! library, can be found in the [`examples`] directory.
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:
//!

//! [dependencies]
//! serenity = "0.5"
//! ```
//!
//! and to the top of your `main.rs`:
