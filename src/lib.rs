//! Serenity is a Rust library for the Discord API.
//!
//! View the [examples] on how to make and structure a bot.
//!
//! Serenity supports bot user authentication via the use of [`Client::new`].
//!
//! Once logged in, you may add handlers to your client to dispatch [`Event`]s,
//! such as [`Client::on_message`]. This will cause your handler to be called
//! when a [`Event::MessageCreate`] is received. Each handler is given a
//! [`Context`], giving information about the event. See the
//! [client's module-level documentation].
//!
//! The [`Shard`] is transparently handled by the library, removing
//! unnecessary complexity. Sharded connections are automatically handled for
//! you. See the [gateway's documentation][gateway docs] for more information.
//!
//! A [`Cache`] is also provided for you. This will be updated automatically for
//! you as data is received from the Discord API via events. When calling a
//! method on a [`Context`], the cache will first be searched for relevant data
//! to avoid unnecessary HTTP requests to the Discord API. For more information,
//! see the [cache's module-level documentation][cache docs].
//!
//! Note that, although this documentation will try to be as up-to-date and
//! accurate as possible, Discord hosts [official documentation][docs]. If you
//! need to be sure that some information piece is sanctioned by Discord, refer
//! to their own documentation.
//!
//! ### Full Examples
//!
//! Full examples, detailing and explaining usage of the basic functionality of the
//! library, can be found in the [`examples`] directory.
//!
//! # Installation
