//! Sharding is a method for load-balancing bots across separate threads or processes. Sharding is
//! enforced on bots by Discord once they reach a certain number of guilds (2500). Once this
//! threshold is reached, a but must be sharded such that at most 2500 guilds are allocated per
//! shard.
//!
//! The "recommended" number of guilds per shard is _around_ 1000. Sharding allows for bots to be
//! distributed by handing shards off to separate processes or even separate machines in a
//! distributed network (e.g. cloud workers). However, sometimes you may wish for all shards to
//! share some global state. Serenity accomodates both of these usecases.
//!
//! See [Discord's documentation][docs] for more information.
//!
//! This module also provides some lower-level facilities for performing sharding manually:
//!
//! ### [`ShardManager`]
//!
//! The shard manager provides a clean interface for communicating with shard runners either
//! individually or collectively, with functions such as [`ShardManager::shutdown`] and
//! [`ShardManager::restart`] to manage shards in a fine-grained way.
//!
//! For most use cases, the [`ShardManager`] will fit all your low-level sharding needs.
//!
//! ### [`ShardQueuer`]
//!
//! A light wrapper around an mpsc receiver that receives [`ShardQueuerMessage`]s. It should be run
//! in its own thread so it can receive messages to start shards concurrently in a queue.
//!
//! ### [`ShardRunner`]
//!
//! The shard runner is responsible for directly running a single shard and communicating with the
//! gateway through its respective WebSocket client. It performs actions such as identifying,
//! reconnecting, resuming, and sending presence updates to the gateway.
//!
