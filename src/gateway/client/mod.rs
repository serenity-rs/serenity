//! The [`Client`] contains information about a bot's token, as well as event handlers. Dispatching
//! events to handlers and starting sharded gateway connections is handled directly by the client.
//! In addition, the client automatically handles caching via the [`Cache`] struct.
//!
//! # Sharding
//!
//! If you do not require sharding - such as for a small bot - then use [`Client::start`]. If you
//! don't know what sharding is, refer to the [`sharding`] module documentation.
//!
//! There are a few methods of sharding available:
//! - [`Client::start_autosharded`]: retrieves the number of shards Discord recommends using from
//!   the API, and then automatically starts that number of shards.
//! - [`Client::start_shard`]: starts a single shard for use in the instance, handled by the
//!   instance of the Client. Use this if you only want 1 shard handled by this instance.
//! - [`Client::start_shards`]: starts all shards in this instance. This is best for when you want a
//!   completely shared State.
//! - [`Client::start_shard_range`]: start a range of shards within this instance. This should be
//!   used when you, for example, want to split 10 shards across 3 instances.
//!
//! Click [here][Client#examples] for an example on how to use a [`Client`].
