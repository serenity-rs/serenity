//! Contains the necessary plumping for maintaining a connection with Discord.
//! The primary building blocks are the [`Client`] and the [`Shard`].
//!
//! The [`Client`] is a high-level interface that takes care of communicating with Discord's REST
//! API as well as receiving and dispatching events from the gateway using a WebSocket client.
//!
//! On the other hand, the [`Shard`] is a low-level receiver and sender representing a single
//! connection to Discord. The client will handle shard management automatically for you, so you
//! should only care about using it directly if you really need to. See the [`sharding`] module for
//! details and documentation.
