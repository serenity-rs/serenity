//! The gateway module contains the pieces - primarily the `Shard` - responsible for maintaining a
//! WebSocket connection with Discord.
//!
//! A shard is an interface for the lower-level receiver and sender. It provides what can otherwise
//! be thought of as "sugar methods". A shard represents a single connection to Discord. You can
//! make use of a method named "sharding" to have multiple shards, potentially offloading some
//! server load to another server(s).
//!
//! # Sharding
//!
//! Sharding is a method to split portions of bots into separate processes. This is an enforced
//! strategy by Discord once a bot reaches a certain number of guilds (2500). Once this number is
//! reached, a bot must be sharded in a way that only 2500 guilds maximum may be allocated per
//! shard.
//!
//! The "recommended" number of guilds per shard is _around_ 1000. Sharding can be useful for
//! splitting processes across separate servers. Often you may want some or all shards to be in the
//! same process, allowing for a shared State. This is possible through this library.
//!
//! See [Discord's documentation][docs] for more information.
//!
//! If you are not using a bot account or do not require sharding - such as for a small bot - then
//! use [`Client::start`].
//!
//! There are a few methods of sharding available:
//! - [`Client::start_autosharded`]: retrieves the number of shards Discord recommends using from
//! the API, and then automatically starts that number of shards.
//! - [`Client::start_shard`]: starts a single shard for use in the instance, handled by the
//! instance of the Client. Use this if you only want 1 shard handled by this instance.
//! - [`Client::start_shards`]: starts all shards in this instance. This is best for when you want
//! a completely shared State.
//! - [`Client::start_shard_range`]: start a range of shards within this instance. This should be
//! used when you, for example, want to split 10 shards across 3 instances.
//!
