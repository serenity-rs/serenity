  Represents a rich embed which allows using richer markdown,
  multiple columns and more. This was heavily inspired by [slack's
  attachments](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments).

  You can include an attachment in your own message by a user or a bot,
  or in a webhook. They can be edited, too.
