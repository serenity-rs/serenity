  Represents a rich embed which allows using richer markdown, multiple fields
  and more. This was heavily inspired by [slack's attachments].


  You can include an attachment in your own message by a user or a bot,
  or in a webhook.


  **Note**: Maximum amount of characters you can put is 256 in a field name,
  1024 in a field value, and 2048 in a description.
