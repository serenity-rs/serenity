// Serenity implements transparent sharding in a way that you do not need to
// manually handle separate processes or connections manually.
//
// Transparent sharding is useful for a shared cache. Instead of having caches
// with duplicated data, a shared cache means all your data can be easily
// accessible across all shards.
//
// If your bot is on many guilds - or over the maximum of 2500 - then you
// should/must use guild sharding.
//
// This is an example file showing how guild sharding works. For this to
// properly be able to be seen in effect, your bot should be in at least 2
// guilds.
//
// Taking a scenario of 2 guilds, try saying "!ping" in one guild. It should
// print either "0" or "1" in the console. Saying "!ping" in the other guild,
// it should cache the other number in the console. This confirms that guild
// sharding works.
