//! This is an example showing how to interact with the client's `ShardManager`,
//! which is a struct that can be used to interact with shards. This allows an
//! easy method of retrieving shards' current status, restarting them, or
//! shutting them down.
//!
//! In this example, we run two shards; this means that there will be two
//! WebSocket connections to Discord, and each will receive events for
//! _approximately_ 1/2 of all guilds that the bot is on.
//!
//! This isn't particularly useful for small bots, but is useful for large bots
//! that may need to split load on separate VPSs or dedicated servers.
//! Additionally, Discord requires that there be at least one shard for every
//! 2500 guilds that a bot is on.
//!
//! For the purposes of this example, we'll print the current statuses of the
//! two shards to the terminal every 30 seconds. This includes the ID of the
//! shard, the current connection stage, (e.g. "Connecting" or "Connected"), and
//! the approximate WebSocket latency (time between when a heartbeat is sent to
//! Discord and when a heartbeat acknowledgement is received).
//!
//! # Notes
//!
//! Note that it may take a minute or more for a latency to be recorded or to
//! update, depending on how often Discord tells the client to send a heartbeat.
